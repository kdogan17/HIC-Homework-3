    <p>Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio Website. My name is Khalia Dogan, I am 20 years old and I love technology and art.</p>
    <p>I am a third year undergraduate student at Kent State University. I am majoring in Computer Science and I enjoy learning how to code, develop and design software. </p>
    <p>I also enjoy robotics and making various games. I like to draw digitally or traditionally and write during my free time. <br> I want to either become a graphic designer or a game designer when I graduate from university.</p>
