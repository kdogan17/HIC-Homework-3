    <h3>Robotics</h3>
    <p>This project was made during my time at the robotics club. This robot runs autonomously and can also be controlled using game controllers. <br> I helped with parts of the design but I mainly focused on programming the robot's movements and behaviors. At first, I didn't fully understand how to code the robot but over time I learned more about how to make the robot move and how to designate controls to certain button commands.</p>

    <h3>Game Project</h3>
    <p>This is a gaming project I made as my capstone project during my junior and senior year in Excel Tecc. The game is a simple 2D rpg where players navigate through different levels, fight enemies and bosses, and collect items. I was working with one other person and I mainly did the character and enemy design aspect of the game. I was able to learn a good amount of game design and it really taught me collaboration and what goes into designing and programming a game.</p>

    <h3>Coding Project</h3>
    <p>This individual project serves to take a txt file of equations and either put them in prefix or postfix notation. This segment of code here breaks the pre/post fix down and evaluates the expression accordingly. Depending on the input from the file, the code will determine what operation is being done and push it into the stack which will later be outputted. At first, this project was a bit confusing trying to understand how to properly determine the evaluation. But with time and research the concept made more sense to me and I got a better understanding of data structures and how stacks functioned.</p>
